# Exploration Algorithm Logic

The sappu_frontier_explorer implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach on a topological graph to handle the unique challenges of sub-terrain environments, such as forks and loops.

### 1. Perception and Splitting

* 180 FOV: The drone only considers frontiers within a 180-degree horizontal field of view in front of its current heading.
* Candidate Generation: Detected frontiers are split into Left and Right groups based on their relative angle to the drone.
* Averaging: The algorithm computes the average 3D position (centroid) for both the left and right groups to find two potential candidate points.

### 2. Decision Rules

* Fork Detection: If both left and right candidates exist, the drone checks the midpoint between them.
* Wall Check: If the midpoint is blocked by a wall (occupied voxel in Octomap), the area is flagged as a True Fork.
* Always Left: In a True Fork, the drone always prioritizes the Left candidate.
* Wide Corridors: If the midpoint is free (not a wall), the drone proceeds toward the center to maintain a safe distance from walls.

### 3. Graph Memory and States

* Area Nodes: The drone creates an AreaNode every 7 meters or whenever a True Fork is detected.
* Exploring Mode: The default state where the drone pursues new frontiers using the Always Left rule.
* Loop Closure: If the drone comes within 4 meters of an existing node (that is not its immediate parent), it identifies a loop. It marks the current path as closed and switches to Backtracking Mode.
* Backtracking Mode: The drone follows the graph nodes in reverse (toward the parent_id). If it reaches a Fork Node where the right branch has not been taken, it switches back to Exploring Mode to map that branch.

## Project Requirements Fulfillment

* Autonomous Navigation: The system requires no manual waypoints inside the cave, relying entirely on the frontier exploration algorithm.
* Mapping: Generates a 3D voxel-grid representation of the cave using Octomap.
* Architecture: Modular design with clear separation between high-level logic and low-level control.
